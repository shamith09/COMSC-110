Part D)

The function in subArrays_itr.cpp has the loop that increments end nested in the loop that increments start. Because of this, this function holds start constant and loops through all possible values of end. When end is too large, start is incremented. 

The function in subArrays_recur.cpp has the statement subArrays(arr, size, start+1, end); in the else if statement. This means that start is incremented until it is equal to end, then end is incremented. Start and end are incremented in the opposite order of the iterative function, so the output is reversed.
